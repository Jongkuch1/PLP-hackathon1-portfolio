## üé® My Design Choices

### Color Scheme
I chose a professional navy blue and sky blue theme because:

- Semantic HTML for accessibility
- CSS animations for smooth user experience

## üíª Technologies I Used

- **HTML5**: For the structure and content

- **JavaScript**: Minimal usage for the About popup functionality
